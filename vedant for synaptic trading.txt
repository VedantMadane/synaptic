Statistics of the flow:
55 bars total
out of which
-50 bars (warm-up period for MA(50))
out of which
305 bars available for trading
out of which
9 MA crossovers detected
out of which
-7 signals BLOCKED by RSI filter (78%)
out of which
2 trades executed (22%)

Backtest executed only 2 trades out of 9 potential MA crossover signals because the RSI filter blocked 7 of them.

Both trades were lossy:

Trade 1 (LONG): Lost -$10.73

    Entered at $108.79 (near the peak)

    Market immediately crashed -10.64%

    Exited at $98.09

    This was the WORST possible timing

Trade 2 (SHORT): Lost -$0.01

    Entered at $98.09 (the absolute bottom)

    Market had no more downside

    Fees ate the tiny movement


Results:
Starting: $100,000.00
Ending: $99,989.26
PnL: -$10.74
Trades: 2
Max Drawdown: -0.01%

Suggested improvement based on my observation:

Adding a 2% stop loss: Trade 1 would have lost -$2.00 instead of -$10.73 (78% improvement)

Adding a 1% take profit: Trade 1 hit $109.91 (+1.03%) and would have exited with +$1.09 profit instead of -$10.73


The strategy is working correctly. It's just showing what would happen in this unfavorable 6-hour market period.
